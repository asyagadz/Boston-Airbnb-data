# Boston-Airbnb-data
This is the dataset I choose for the first project in the Data Science Nanodegree. Data is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston
The purpose of the project is to choose a dataset and choose 3 questions to answer from the data chosen.

## Installations
A list with the modules used and packages are provided in requirements.txt file

## Project Motivation
This project is the first project from Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree  - the Introduction to Data Science. 
I have defined the following three questions to answer:
1. When are the busiest times in Boston? 
2. Which are the most crowded neighbourhoods in Boston in terms of AirBNB frequencies?
3. What drives/defines the prices of the AirBNB in Boston? Which are the top variables that affect the price?
