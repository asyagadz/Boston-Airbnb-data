# Boston-Airbnb-data
This is the dataset I choose for the first project in the Data Science Nanodegree. Data is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston
The purpose of the project is to choose a dataset and choose 3 questions to answer from the data chosen.

## Project Motivation
This project is the first project from Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree  - the Introduction to Data Science. 
I have defined the following three questions to answer:
1. When are the busiest times in Boston? 
2. Which are the most crowded neighbourhoods in Boston in terms of AirBNB listings?
3. What drives/defines the prices of the AirBNB in Boston? Which are the top variables that affect the price? 


## File Descriptions
The project contains:
- A Readme.md file
- Notebook folder
  - 01.01.-ag-initial-analysis.ipynb - I explore the raw data files as downloaded from Kaggle
  - 02.01.-ag-data-cleaning.ipynb - drop irrelevant features and add new features
  - 02.02.-ag-data-cleaning-feature-engineering-description.ipynb - explore the Description field from listings dataset - transform and vectorize data in order to find meaningful insights; it is a complementary notebook
  - 02.03.-ag-data-cleaning-feature-engineering-other-text-columns.ipynb - explore other text columns from listings data; it is a complementary notebook
  - 03.01.-ag-feature-engineering.ipynb - this notebook contains all imputings of missing values, additional transformations of features, binning, discretization, outliers handling
  - 04.01.-ag-feature-selection-modelling-price-prediction.ipynb - this notebook contains the modelling part performed and chosen for question 3.
  - 05.01.-ag-exploratory-data-analysis.ipynb - this notebook contains the descriptive and visualisation analysis that provides answers to the three questions to the dataset.
- src folder:
  - data:
    - raw data - the raw files as downloaded from Kaggle
    - processed data - the files processed throughtout the different steps of the project.


## How to Interact with your project/Results
TBased on the analysis performed, we have seen some interesting information about the AirBNBs in Boston:

- beginning of Autumn is the busiest period for the airBNBs occupancy rates
- there are neighbourhoods that reveal a capacity for new AirBNBs.
- a more precise modelling and data mining is necessary to build more robust model, that explains better what affect the prices and its values.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.
I have used some functions or code that is from Feature Engineering course & Feature Selection course from Udemy, lead by Soledad Galli.
